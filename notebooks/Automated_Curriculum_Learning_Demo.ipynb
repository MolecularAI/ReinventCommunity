    "The aim of this notebook is to illustrate how `REINVENT` can be used for the _de novo_ design of molecules in a *Curriculum Learning* (CL) setup. The general idea of CL is to decompose a Production Objective (target properties for the proposed molecules) into simpler sequential Curriculum Objectives to accelerate convergence: \n",

    "The purpose of the Curriculum Objectives is to guide the REINVENT agent to areas of chemical space that satisfy the Production Objective. The order of Curriculum Objectives is user-defined and each Objective (Curriculum and Production) can consist of any REINVENT scoring function component(s), e.g., Tanimoto similarity. Progression through Curriculum Objectives is controlled by a threshold (can be specified for different Objectives) which the agent must achieve.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following section, we will show how to set up an `Automated Curriculum Learning` `REINVENT` run that gradually generates compounds possessing a target scaffold (which is not present in the training set of the provided prior) that represents a difficult task for a standard `REINVENT` run. The target scaffold is dihydro-pyrazoloquinazoline and is a known active scaffold against 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1). The reference paper is:\n",

    "Overview of important `REINVENT` parameters:\n",
    "* **Diversity Filter**: If the agent becomes very focussed, it tends to produce the similar molecules over and over (because they return high scores). To enrich different scaffolds, we can activate the diversity filter, which will \"bin\" the molecules into groups (scaffolds). Once a given bin is full, all other molecules with the same scaffold will be penalized score-wise, effectively \"pushing\" the agent out of a local minimum in the score landscape thus enriching diversity. \n",
    "* **Inception**: Sometimes agents \"linger around\" for a while before they (by chance) happen to pick up a trace and generate interesting compounds. To speed up this very early exploration, we can *incept* a couple of promising molecules as list of `SMILES`. Inception also allows storing of molecules up to `memory_size` which correspond to the highest scoring molecules which can be replayed back to the agent to keep it on track.\n",
    "\n",
    "These 2 parameters are relevant for any `REINVENT` experiment but there are additional features and considerations for a Curriculum Learning experiment. Curriculum Learning is split into a Curriculum Phase and Production Phase. During the Curriculum Phase, Curriculum Objectives are used to guide the agent to favourable chemical space. During the Production Phase, the Production Objective is activated and the agent samples for a pre-defined number of epochs, presumably generating favourable molecules. \n",
    "1) A separate and distinct **Diversity Filter** can be specified in the Curriculum and Production Phases. This is particularly relevant as perhaps a **Diversity Filter** is not desired during the Curriculum Phase since the goal is to guide the agent to favourable chemical space and not necessarily generate molecules that satisfy the Production Objective (target objective). Conversely, once the Production Phase starts, initializing a **Diversity Filter** can ensure agent sampling of diverse minima to balance exploration and exploitation (Setting up a **Diversity Filter** for the Production Phase will be shown in the \"Specify the Production Strategy\" section)\n",
    "\n",
    "2) A separate and distinct **Inception** can also be specified in the Curriculum and Production Phases. A relevant use case is that any stored molecules in the **Inception** memory during the Curriculum Phase may not be relevant in the Production Phase. In this case, initializing a new **Inception** will clear the memory. \n",
