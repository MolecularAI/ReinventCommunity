    "This is a simple example of running `Reinvent` with only 1 score component (`Icolos`).

    "In this notebook, we will demonstrate how to use `Icolos` with `REINVENT`. `AutoDock Vina 1.2.0` with `RDkit` embedding will be used as the molecular docking component.\n",

    "### Details\n",
    "* An example receptor file (in `PDBQT` format, as expected by `AutoDock Vina`) is provided in the _data_ subfolder of this repository. Note, that you need to specify the location and the dimensions of the search space according to your protein target. `Icolos` has a _target preparation_ step implemented that can assist you with that.\n",
    "* Receptors / Grids can be named by using parameter `grid_id`. This allows to track which receptor led to which score afterwards, e.g. in case ensemble docking was used.\n",
    "* `REINVENT` hands over the path to a input `JSON` file (so the input block in the `Icolos` workflow must be using `{input_json_path}`, a _global variable_ that is set automatically, as input source). Likewise, `Icolos` will need to write the result(s) to the file specified by `{output_json_path}`. From the point of view of `Icolos`, there is nothing special about these global variables and they are handed over in the same manner as any other. For details on how to use and define _global variables_ in `Icolos`, please have a look at the respective material.\n",
    "* Also, `REINVENT` sets a thrid global variable `step_id`, which contains the current step / epoch number. This can be used to write-out consecutive files, so that you can trace the batch of compounds a specific epoch has generated.\n",
    "* `Icolos` supports an arbitrary number of write-outs (actually for each step, if so desired). For usage in `REINVENT` the write-out of the result `JSON` is mandatory, but in this example we also store the docking scores as a `CSV` and the poses in an `SDF` file."
