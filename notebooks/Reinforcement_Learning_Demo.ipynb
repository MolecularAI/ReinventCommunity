    "# `REINVENT 2.0`: reinforcement learning demo\n",
    "The aim of this notebook is to illustrate how `REINVENT` can be used for the _de novo_ design of molecules in a *Reinforcement Learning* (RL) setup. The general idea is to start with a (somewhat) focussed prior and to define a (complex) scoring function from a set of building blocks (*components*) to decide which molecules are \"good\" or \"bad\". Each molecule generated by the _agent_ will thus receive a score from 0 to 1 and this feedback is used to train the agent over time, i.e. to focus it on chemical regions of interest for a given project.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](img/REINVENT_RL_mode.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "One of `REINVENT`'s most powerful features is the flexible way in which the scoring function can be defined. By adding together a multitude of different components, the tool is able to generate molecules that are e.g. predicted to be active against a given target, soluble, non-toxic and below a certain molecular weight - all at the same time. More complex components also allow to enrich in molecules that are e.g. active against a given receptor but not against a set of off-targets, i.e. they are pushed for selectivity.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following sections, we will show how to set up a fairly complex `REINVENT` run that optimizes molecules to be selective against _Aurora_ kinase (we will use one off-target). In addition, we will set further constraints e.g. the number of hydrogen bond donors, all of which will be optimized in parallel.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Steps to sucessfully apply `REINVENT`:\n",
    "1. Think about the goals and prepare the input\n",
    "  * Often, we will use predictive models of some sort, e.g. activity models. For those, we calculate fingerprints (e.g. `ECFP` descriptors) and map these input features to some response variable, either as a (binary) classification or regression. For this notebook, we supply two models (Random Forest regressors) for Aurora and B-RAF, which can be found in the `data` subfolder of the `REINVENT` repository. A more detailed description is given below, but usually these models are simple `scikit-learn` models with standard algorithms (Random Forest, SVR, ...).\n",
    "  * Sometimes, we want to generate molecules that match a given (sub-)structure, so we need a way to enforce a match. In the opposite scenario, we want to avoid certain matches (e.g. because we want to move out of IP-crowded chemical space). We can define `SMARTS` to achieve both, see details below.\n",
    "  * Some (physico-chemical) properties are very important and should be incorporated during the RL run. We make use of `RDkit`'s implementation of certain descriptors to e.g. ensure that a maximum number of rings is not exceeded.\n",
    "  * Another important factor is the use of an appropriate _prior_, that embodies much of chemistry learned. We supply one in the `data` subfolder (`augmented.prior`) and will also use it to initialize the agent in this example.\n",
    "2. Chose a `JSON` template (or build from scratch) and update:\n",
    "  * The paths to the prior and initial agent.\n",
    "  * The output paths to the _progress.log_ and _results_ folders (logging).\n",
    "  * The scoring function components (add or delete, update paths and parameters, set weights, ...).\n",
    "3. Run `REINVENT`\n",
    "4. Analysis:\n",
    "  * Inspect the output of the run with `tensorboard`\n",
    "  * Look at the molecules generated in the result directory\n",
    "  * Apply *post-processing* where appropriate\n",
    "\n",
    "To proceed, please update the following code block such that it reflects your system's installation and execute it."

    "## Setting up the configuration\n",
    "`REINVENT` has an entry point that loads a specified `JSON` file on startup. `JSON` is a low-level data format that allows to specify a fairly large number of parameters in a cascading fashion very quickly. The parameters are structured into *blocks* which can in turn contain blocks or simple values, such as *True* or *False*, strings and numbers. In this tutorial, we will go through the different blocks step-by-step, explaining their purpose and potential values for given parameters. Note, that while we will write out the configuration as a `JSON` file in the end, in `python` we handle the same information as a simple `dict`."

    "\n",
    "* `diversity_filter`: If the agent becomes very focussed, it tends to produce the similar molecules over and over (because they return high scores). To enrich different scaffolds, we can activate the diversity filter, which will \"bin\" the molecules into groups (scaffolds). Once a given bin is full, all other molecules with the same scaffold will be penalized score-wise, effectively \"pushing\" the agent out of a local minimum in the score landscape thus enriching diversity.\n",
    "* `inception`: Sometimes agents \"linger around\" for a while before they (by chance) happen to pick up a trace and generate interesting compounds. To speed up this very early exploration, we can *incept* a couple of promising molecules as list of `SMILES`.\n",
    "* `reinforcement_learning`: This block holds all the parameters which are specific for the reinforcement running mode (see detailed description in the code). One important question is, which prior and initial agent to use: these are just models that have been trained on a large compound library to ensure they have learned \"basic chemical rules\". While the prior does not change over the course of the training (its feedback will be used to keep the agent in the realm of good chemistry), the agent is updated each *epoch* (step). In this case we have used *augmented* `SMILES` representation of `Chembl` data for both the prior and to initialize the agent."

    "### Define the scoring function\n",
    "Now all that remains to be done is the most tricky step: define a scoring function that allows the agent to identify promising suggestions and discard molecules that are of no interest to the project. It is not necessarily better to build a very complex scoring function (on the contrary it can make it hard for the agent to find appropriate solutions). Always bear in mind that there is a post-processing step at the end, in which you will be able to discard molecules either by eye-inspection or by applying further (probably more expensive) methods you have not used in the reinforcement learning loop. The following example will include fair share of the available scoring function components (added one-by-one), but this is for illustrative purposes only.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Score transformation\n",
    "Before we start, there is one more topic requiring some explanation: *score transformations*. Remember that every component returns a value between '0' and '1' (higher values meaning \"better\") and all scores together are combined into a *total score* for a given compound (also between '0' and '1'). This is key, as the agent will try to generate molecules with ever increasing scores over the course of training, i.e. the numerical value \"guides\" the agent. However, some components might not naturally return values between '0' or '1' or they might represent the opposite, i.e. '0' being \"good\" rather than \"bad\". This is component-specific and to make it as flexible as possible, we include the specification of a score transformation for each component. We support multiple different functions (`sigmoid`, `reverse_sigmoid` and so on) which have different parameters to allow tweaking them to the desired result. For more details and to see how different parameter values affect the result, we refer to the dedicated notebook which is also part of this repository."
