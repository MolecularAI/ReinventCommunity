    "# `REINVENT 2.0`: scoring mode demo\n",
    "One of the more common running modes of `REINVENT 2.0` in a project setting is the *scoring mode*. As is described in detail in the *reinforcement learning* notebooks, an agent can learn (iteratively) to maximise the reward given by a scoring function. Recall that this function can be a (complex) combination of scoring components and it is not always straightforward to predict how a given compound will score. A common use case is to have a couple of compounds at the beginning of the project that are considered \"good\" and one would like to ensure that they score highly. If not, there is still the possibility to change the scoring function accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this scenario, one can subject a file with molecules in the `SMILES` format to a scoring run, which is illustrated by this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "To proceed, please update the following code block such that it reflects your system's installation and execute it."

    "## Setting up the configuration\n",
    "`REINVENT` has an entry point that loads a specified `JSON` file on startup. `JSON` is a low-level data format that allows to specify a fairly large number of parameters in a cascading fashion very quickly. The parameters are structured into *blocks* which can in turn contain blocks or simple values, such as *True* or *False*, strings and numbers. In this tutorial, we will go through the different blocks step-by-step, explaining their purpose and potential values for given parameters. Note, that while we will write out the configuration as a `JSON` file in the end, in `python` we handle the same information as a simple `dict`."

    "### Define the scoring function\n",
    "Now all that remains to be done is the most tricky step: define a scoring function that allows to identify promising suggestions and discard molecules that are of no interest to the project. It is not necessarily better to build a very complex scoring function (on the contrary it can make it hard for the agent to find appropriate solutions). Always bear in mind that there is a post-processing step at the end, in which you will be able to discard molecules either by eye-inspection or by applying further (probably more expensive) methods you have not used in the reinforcement learning loop. The following example will include fair share of the available scoring function components (added one-by-one), but this is for illustrative purposes only.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Score transformation\n",
    "Before we start, there is one more topic requiring some explanation: *score transformations*. Remember that every component returns a value between '0' and '1' (higher values meaning \"better\") and all scores together are combined into a *total score* for a given compound (also between '0' and '1'). This is key, as the agent will try to generate molecules with ever increasing scores over the course of training, i.e. the numerical value \"guides\" the agent. However, some components might not naturally return values between '0' or '1' or they might represent the opposite, i.e. '0' being \"good\" rather than \"bad\". This is component-specific and to make it as flexible as possible, we include the specification of a score transformation for each component. We support multiple different functions (`sigmoid`, `reverse_sigmoid` and so on) which have different parameters to allow tweaking them to the desired result. For more details and to see how different parameter values affect the result, we refer to the dedicated notebook which is also part of this repository."
