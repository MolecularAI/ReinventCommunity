    "#### The *transfer learning* mode can be used for either\n",
    "    1. Initial training of the Agent - where a newly built agent is trained from scratch while iterating through sufficiently large datasets over many epochs \n",
    "    2. Focusing of pre-trained Agent - where an already pre-trained agent is introduced to a small dataset for a small number of epochs.\n",
    "In this notebook we are going to illustrate the second scenario. The small dataset can consist of a few hundred molecules that normally share same features/scaffolds. The purpose of `Focusing` is to \"learn\" the common patterns/scaffolds in the structures. The `Focused` Agent will start producing with higher probablility the molecules with the common scaffolds. \n",
    "The `Focused` Agent can be used directly for *reinforcement learning* thus having as a starting point the small chemical space it has been focused on. "

    "## Setting up the configuration\n",
    "`REINVENT` has an entry point that loads a specified `JSON` file on startup. `JSON` is a low-level data format that allows to specify a fairly large number of parameters in a cascading fashion very quickly. The parameters are structured into *blocks* which can in turn contain blocks or simple values, such as *True* or *False*, strings and numbers. In this tutorial, we will go through the different blocks step-by-step, explaining their purpose and potential values for given parameters. Note, that while we will write out the configuration as a `JSON` file in the end, in `python` we handle the same information as a simple `dict`."
